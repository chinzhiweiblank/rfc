## Objective

CoreDNS is the cluster DNS server for Kubernetes and is very critical for the overall health of the Kubernetes cluster. It is important to monitor the health of CoreDNS itself and restarting or repairing any CoreDNS pods that are not behaving correctly.  
 
While CoreDNS exposes a health check itself in the form of Kubernetes’ `livenessProbe`: 


- The health check is not UDP (DNS) based. There have been cases where the health port is accessible (for TCP) but CoreDNS itself isn't (UDP). This protocol difference means that CoreDNS is unhealthy from a cluster standpoint, but the control plane can't see this.  
- The existing health check is also launched locally (the `kubelet` uses the `livenessProbe`) and the situation could be different for pods accessing it remotely. 
 
## Motivation and Scope


This project idea aims to get around limitations on Kubernetes’ health check and build an application that: 


- Checks CoreDNS health externally through UDP (DNS), from a remote Golang application. 
- Restart CoreDNS pods by interacting with Kubernetes API through the Golang application, if the response from the cluster and pod IPs is unsatisfactory.  

Thus, making the state of CoreDNS available externally and reliably is important to ensure important services run as they are expected to. A shell script could’ve been used to automate the steps but shell is not good in error handling and may not be reliable depending on which shell (bash/csh/zsh) to use. A Golang program will be much more robust.  
 
### Deliverables  


- A standalone Golang application to check CoreDNS health: 
  - The binary delivered through this project will be a **flexible** application in that it could choose its approach to the problem depending on the environment it is deployed in and the access that has been provided to it.   
  - The health check program itself doesn’t necessarily reside in the Kubernetes cluster. 
  - This binary only concerns itself with the health of CoreDNS deployed on Kubernetes. It doesn’t cover other scenarios. 


- Proper documentation for the product explaining steps and the concepts used. 
 
 
 

 
## Design Proposal 


It is necessary to consider all possible cases because the way any team deploys the binary is their **choice** and we should not be forcing a modus operandi to use the product.  
 
Minimal assumptions about the users’ Kubernetes deployment are made and the primary **focus** is to build a program that could easily be adopted by more teams (which may have different preferences of deployment). 
 
In any case, the binary will accomplish the following fundamental tasks: 


- Use `kubectl` to extract information about the cluster and its services and pods.  
 
  This will help determine the procedure to follow and also facilitate the subsequent actions to take. This step can be completed only when the application can connect and communicate with the API server. The Go [client](https://github.com/kubernetes/client-go) for Kubernetes has packages that can discover and authenticate with the API server.  
 
- Find the IP address (cluster IP and pod IP) of the CoreDNS service and pods.  
 
  These IP addresses will be used for the `dig` operation in the next steps. It is critical to use both cluster IP and the pod IP. Although it may seem that pinging cluster IP would be sufficient, in real production systems, any point of the system could fail. We cannot make the assumption that Kubernetes networking (forwarding requests from the Service IP to the Pods) will work all the time.  
 
  Apart from this, it’ll be useful to know which Pods are sick, so they can be remedied individually.  
 
- Use `dig` to ping the cluster IP and pod IPs through DNS. 
 
  `dig` is a tool that can be used to look up DNS servers using their IP addresses and port numbers (default is 53). The output of the command execution will help determine whether the DNS service is healthy or not.  
 
- Restart CoreDNS pods through the API server if pods are up and running but DNS reply does not match the expectation. 


 
### Strategies for Different Deployment Scenarios 

I have listed out four possible scenarios that the binary might be deployed in. Out of these, three have a determinate solution and can be implemented right away. The last one will require some hacking and also relies on a feature which is under development. 
- **Binary Deployed as a Pod** 


  Here, the team decides to launch the binary as a health check pod using `kubectl` and a YAML configuration. The steps listed above can then be directly executed with no additional configuration or modifications required.  


- **Binary Deployed Externally but Creating/Deleting Pods Inside the Cluster Allowed** 
![CoreDNSPod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37150991/75658062-9220f900-5c8d-11ea-8c13-f48fbcecc37a.jpeg)
 
 
  Here, the binary itself lives as an external program but will dynamically create a lightweight pod in the cluster (through communication with the API server). The only purpose of this pod inside the cluster would be to execute the dig command (and maybe other debug commands) that the external Golang application sends to this pod. 
  
  We can also get rid of the pod right after a check and create one the next time we are running a check so the main application doesn't actually live on the cluster and isn't affected by it. 


  The pod is just created so that accessing the private k8s cluster network becomes simple (no routing or proxy required). It is straightforward to run a shell in a container (through kubectl exec) and then equally simple to run the dig commands in the shell. 


- **Binary Deployed Externally and DNS Port Exposed** 
![CoreDNSNodePort](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37150991/75658133-b5e43f00-5c8d-11ea-87de-2dc14f965cd3.jpeg)

  Here, the DNS port or the UDP port 53 (in standard deployment) of the CoreDNS deployment is exposed through a service to the external world. The binary, deployed externally, can then use this service to ping the endpoints using the dig command.  
 

- **Creation of Pods Forbidden and DNS Port Not Exposed**


  In such a case, the binary (living as an external program) would have very limited options to interact with the cluster. However, there is a way this scenario can be tackled elegantly and that is through a port-forward.  


  Port-forward creates a connection between a port on our application host and the port we want to connect to on a pod, inside the cluster.  Although port-forward works only for TCP connections currently, there is an active issue to bring the functionality to UDP ports and I’ll be tracking the issue over the next months to see if something can be hacked together.

Timeline 
-

**Before 20th May:** 

I’ll get comfortable with the Go language and DNS concepts. I’ll bond with the community and understand what test systems, coding practices and principles are followed. I’ll stay active on community channels and discuss the idea and solution further to finalize and perfect the approach.

**20th May to 2nd June:**

Develop code to enable the application to determine what scenario and environment it is deployed in.
I will implement a priority order for the different approaches when two or more are existing simultaneously; after deliberations with the mentors.
Ultimately, the app at this stage should be able to transfer control to one of the four cases.

**2nd June to 7th June:**

Test the existing code rigorously and document the process.

**7th June to 22nd June:**

Take on the first case (deployed as a pod) and implement part of the specified API that caters to this situation. A lot of the code written in this period could be reused with some additions or logic control for the remaining cases.

**22nd June to 29th June:**

Test and document the existing code thoroughly.

**30th June to 7th July:**

Implement the part of the API specific to the second case. Some code will need to be added to get the NodePort/LoadBalancer IP in this case. Will also look for other modifications required.

**7th July to 14th July:**

Test and document the application up to this stage and ensure the two cases report correct results and function as expected.

**14th July to 21st July:**

Implement the deployAndExposePod function and check compatibility with code in the existing functions. Figure out if any modifications or utilities are needed.

**21st July to 27th July:**

Test and document the code and ensure all the three cases work as expected.

**Future work:**

Explore options for solving the fourth case and look for any hacks or contributions required to make it work.
 
 

 

## Questions and Discussion Topics

- Are there any deployment cases that I have missed?
- Are there any modifications to the strategies listed above, that should be made?
